            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">It has been proposed to read, "Bring her to; try with the main-course;" but see a
               passage from Hakluyt's Voyages, 1598 quoted by Malone:-- "and when tehe barke had
               way, we cut the hawser and so gate the sea to our friend, and tryed out al that day with our maine corse."

               "heaven's face," it may well be questioned whether "cheeck," in this place is not
               a misprint. Mr. Collier's annotator subsittutes heat, a change characterised by Mr. Dyce as "equally tasteless and absurd."
               A more appropriate and expressive word, one too, sanctioned in some measure by its
               occurrence in Ariel's description of the same elemental conflict, is probably,

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">In Miranda's picture of the tempest, the sea is seen to storm and overhwlem the
               tremendous artillery of heaven; in that of Ariel, the sky's ordnance, "the fire
               and cracks," assault the "mighty Neptune." Crack, in
               the emphatic sense it formerly bore of crash,
               discharge, or explosion, is very common in
               our writers thus, in Marlowe's "Tamburlaine the Great," Part I. Aact IV Sc. 2,

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">By the customary punctuation of this passage, Prospero is made to ask a question

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Mr. Collier remarks that "This word, of old, was used either as a monosyllable or
               as a disyllable, as the case might require." This may be questioned. "Ake," says Baret in his "Alvearie," "is the Verbe of
               the substantive Ach, ch being turned into k." As a
               substantive, then, the word was written aches; and pronounced as a dissyllable: when a verb, it was written akes, and its pronunciation was monosyllabic. This distinction is
               invariably marked in the old text; thus, in "Romeo and Juliet," Act II. Sc. 5,
               where it is a verb,-- 
               
               <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"Lord, how my head akes, what a head have
                  I."
               </p>
                In "Coriolanus," Act III. Sc. 1,-- 
               
               <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"-- and my soule akes</p>
               
               <p style="text-indent: 50px;">To know,"&amp;c.</p>
                And in "Othello," Act IV. Sc. 2,-- 
               
               <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"That the sense akes at thee."</p>
                While in every instance where it occurs as a substantive, it is spelt as in
               the passage above, aches, and should be so
               pronounced.

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">It was customary in the "good old times," for the partners in some dances to
               curtsy and salute before the beginning; and if an allusion to these ceremonies is

            </p>
            
            
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"The wild waves whist,"--</p>
            
            
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">should be read parenthetically, in the sense of, the wild saves being hushed. The
               original punctuation, however,--

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"Court'sied when you have, and kiss'd,</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">(when you have curtsied, and kissed the waves to peace) affords an intelligible

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">This is the great crux of the play. No passage in Shakespeare has occasioned more
               speculation, and on none has speculation proved less happy. The first folio reads,
               "Most busie lest, when I doe it;" the second, "Most
               busie least when I doe it;" Pope prints, "Least busy when I do it;" Theobald, "Most busyless when I do it;" Mr. Holt White suggests,
               "Most busiest when I do it;" and Mr. Collier's
               annotator, "Most busy,-- blest when I do it."
               Whatever may have been teh word for which "lest" was
               misprinted, "Most busy" and that word bore reference, unquestionably, not to
               Ferdinand's task, but to the sweet thoughts by which it was relieved. We have
               substituted felt as a likely word to have been mis-set "lest;" but are in
               doubt whether still, in its old sense of ever, always, is not preferable,-- 
               
               <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"Most busy still, when I do it."</p>

            <p>Each putter-out of five for one--</p>
            
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">It was the custom of travellers, when about to make a long voyage, to put out, or
               invest, a sum of money, upon a guaruntee that they should receive at the rate of
               five for one if they returned. This species of gambling become so much in vogue at
               one period that adventurers were in the practice of undertaking dangerous journeys
               solely upon the speculation of what their puttings-out would yield if they got back safe. Of course when the
               journey ended fatally, the money they had invested went to the party who had
               engaged to pay the enormous interst on it. So, in Barnaby Riche's "Faults and
               Nothing but Faults," 1607: "Those whipsters, that, having spent the greatest part
               of their patrimony in prodigality, will give out the rest of their stocke to be paid two or three for
               one upon their return form Rome." See also Fynes Moryson's "Itinerary,"
               Part I., p. 198, and Taylor, the water poet's pamphlet, called "The Scourge of
               Basenesse: or the Old Lerry, with a new Kicksey, and a new-cum twang, with the old Winsey." The ancient reading is
               usually altered in modern editions to "Each putter-out of one for five," or "Each putter-out on five
               for one," but no change is called for; Shakespeare and his contemporaries commonly
               used of for on,--

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">According to Henley, "pioned and twilled brims meant brims dug and begrimed." Hanmer and Steevens
               contend that the poet had in view the margin of a stream adorned with flowers;
               while Mr. Collier's annotator would read, "pioned and tilled," that is cultivated "brims." We
               must prefer the interpretation of Hanmer and Steevens to either of the others; but
               have not thought it desirable to alter the old text.

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Hanmer changes this to "brown groves," as does Mr.
               Collier's annotator; and a more unhappy alteration can hardly be conceived, since
               it at once destroys the point of the allusion: yellow, the colour of the broom, being supposed especially congenial to
               the lass-lorn and dismissed bachelor. Thus Burton, in his "Anatomy of Melancholy," Part
               III. Sec. 2,-- "So long as we are wooers, and my kiss and coll at our pleasure,
               nothing is so sweet; we are in heaven, as we think: but when we are once tied, and
               have lost our liberty, marriage is an hell: give me my yellow hose again."

               It is pretty evident that Ferdinand expresses a compliment to father and
               daughter; and equally so that the lines were intended to rhyme; with the very
               slight change we have ventured, the passage fulfils both conditions. It is
               noteworthy that the same rhyme occurs in teh opening stanza of our author's

               <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,</p>
               
               <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of
                  thine,--

            </p>
            
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">On this passage Mr. Collier has teh following observations in his last edition:--
               "'Noble' and 'flow' are from the corrected folio, 1632, and, we may be confident,
               are restorations of the poet's language. Why has Prospero to call Gonzalo holy, as the epithet stands in the folios?-- he was
               'noble' and 'honourable,' but in no respect holy;
               the error of show for 'flow' is also transparent,
               and must have been occasioned chiefly by the mistake of the long s for f." In his
               anxiety to sustain the changes proposed by his annotator, Mr. Collier appears to
               have forgotten two or three facts which militate very strongly against them. In
               the first place, the word "holy," in Shakespeare's time, besides its ordinary
               meaning of godly, sanctified, and the like,
               signified also pure, just, righteous, &amp;c.: in
               this sense, Leontes, in "The Winter's Tale," Act V. Sc. 1, speaks of Polixenes as
               "holy,"-- 
               
               <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"You have a holy father,</p>
               
               <p style="text-indent: 50px;">A graceful gentleman."</p>
                In the next place, the old text has "shew,"
               not show; and, thirdly, the misprint, if there were
               one, could not have been occasioned chiefly by the mistake of the long s for f, seeing the sh of "show" in old typography formed a single
               character, fh, which was far less likely to be confounded with the type which
               represented "fl"-- fl, than the single long s with
               f.

            </p>
            
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Mr. Collier's annotator substitutes devil for
               "trifle;" a change as wanton as it is foolish. Trifle meant phantom; thus, in Beaumont and
               Fletcher's "Bonduca," Act V. Sc. 2,-- 
               
               <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"In love too with a trifle to abuse me."</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">So in Act II. Sc. 1, Gonzalo says, "You would lift the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue in it five weeks
               without changing." Thus, too, in Beaumont and Fletcher's play of "The Prophetess,"
               Act II. Sc. 3,-- 
               
               <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"-- the pale moon</p>
               
               <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Pluck'd in her silver horns, trembling for fear</p>
               
               <p style="text-indent: 50px;">That my strong spells should force her from her sphere.</p>
                Douce quotes a marginal note in Adlington's translation of Apuleius, 1596,
               4to. which says, "Witches in old time were supposed to be of such power that they
               could pul downe the moone by their inchantment." The
               classical reader will remember,--

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The striking the top masts was a new invention in Shakespeare's time, which he
               here very properly introduces. Sir Henry Manwaring says, "It is not yet agreed
               amongst all seamen whether it is better for a ship to hull with her topmast up or
               down." In the Postscript to the Seaman's dictionary, he afterwards gives his own
               opinion: "If you have sea-room, it is never good to strike the topmast."
               Shakespeare has placed his ship in the situation in which it was indisputably
               right to strike the topmast, when he had not sea-room.
