               <p>Mr. Collier remarks that "This word, of old, was used either as a monosyllable or
                  as a disyllable, as the case might require." This may be questioned. "<hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">Ake</hi>," says Baret in his "Alvearie," "is the Verbe of
                  the substantive <hi rend="slant(italic)">Ach</hi>, ch being turned into k." As a
                     <hi rend="slant(italic)">substantive</hi>, then, the word was written <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">aches</hi>; and pronounced as a dissyllable: when a <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">verb</hi>, it was written <hi rend="slant(italic)"
                     >akes</hi>, and its pronunciation was monosyllabic. This distinction is
                  invariably marked in the old text; thus, in "Romeo and Juliet," Act II. Sc. 5,
                  where it is a verb,-- <lg>
                     <l>"Lord, how my head <hi rend="slant(italic)">akes</hi>, what a head have
                        I."</l>

                  </lg> While in every instance where it occurs as a substantive, it is spelt as in
                  the passage above, <hi rend="slant(italic)">aches</hi>, and should be so
                  pronounced. </p>

         <div type="prefatory">
            <p>The earliest copy of "The Tempest" known is that in the folio of 1623. To the precise
               date of its production we have no clue, but the following memorandum from the
               "Accounts of the Revels at Court," is almost positive testimony that it was written
               before 1611:--</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="align(left)indent(1)">By the King's Players.</hi><hi rend="align(right)">
                  Hallomas nyght was presented att Whithall ye Kinges Matle, a play called the
                  Tempest</hi></p>

            <p>And the speech of Gonzalo, Act II. Sc. 1,--</p>
            <lg>
               <l>"I' the commonwealth I would by contraries," &amp;c.--</l>
            </lg>
            <p>which is obviously taken from a passage in Florio's translation of Montaigne's
               Essayes, first printed in 1603, is equally decisive as to its having been written
               after that year. The story upon which "The Tempest" is founded, was most probably
               dervied, according to Shakespeare's usual practice, from an existing play or from
               some popular chronicle or romance. Collins the poet, indeed, informed T. Warton, that
               he had met with a novel called <hi rend="slant(italic)">Aurelio and Isabella</hi>,
               printed in Italian, Spanish, French, and English, in 1588, which he conceived to have
               formed the basis of "The Tempest." When he spoke of the circumstance, however,
               Collins was labouring under mental debility, and so far as the particular novel he
               mentioned was concerned his memory deceived him, for the fable of Aurelio and
               Isabella bears no resemblance to that of the play; yet it is remarkable that a friend
               of James Boswell declared that he had once perused an Italian novel which answered to
               Collins's description. In an article on the early English and German dramas published
               in the New Monthly Magazine for January, 1841, Mr. Thoms pointed out a dramatic piece
               by Jacob Ayrer, a notary of Nurnberg, contemporary with Shakespeare, entitled <hi
                  rend="slant(italic)">Die schöne Sidea</hi>, (The Beautiful Sidea,) which bears
               some resemnblance to "The Tempest," and which Tieck conjectured was a translation of
               some old English drama from which Shakespeare borrowed his idea. How far this is
               probably the reader must judge from the following outline of the German play: Ludolph
               having been vanquished by his rival, and with his daughter Sidea driven into a
               forest, rebukes her for complaining of their change of fortune, and then summons his
               spirit Runcifal, who is, like Ariel, somewhat "moody," announces to Ludolph that the
               son of his enemy will shortly become his prisoner. After a comic episode, most
               probably introduced by the German, we see Prince Leudegast, with his son Engelbrecht
               and the councillors, hunting in the same forest; when Engelbrecht and his companion
               Famulus, having separated from the associates, are suddenly encountered by Ludolph
               and his daughter. On his commanding them to yield themselves prisoners, they refuse;
               but on attempting to draw their swords, Ludolph renders them powerless by the touch
               of his magical wand, and gives the prince over to Sidea to carry logs of wood for
               her, and to obey her commands in all respects. The resemblance between the German and
               English plays is continued in a later part of the former production, when Sidea,
               moved by pity for the labours of Engelbrecht in carrying logs, exclaims, she would
               "feel great joy, if he would prove faithful to me, and take me in wedlock;" an event
               which in the end, is happily brought about, and leads to the reconciliation of their
               parents, the rival princes. The title of "The Tempest" is supposed by some
               commentators to have been determined by the shipwreck of Sir George Sommers and Sir
               Thomas Gates on the coast of the Bermudas in 1609;</p>

            <p>of which an account was published by Silvester Jourdan,one of the crew, in the
               following year:-- <hi rend="slant(italic)">A Discovery of the Barmudas ; otherwise
                  called the Isle of Divels ; by Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Sommers, and Captayne
                  Newport, with divers others.</hi> It is highly probable, too, that Jourdan's and
               other accounts of the Bermudas, by some of which they are said to be enchanted and
               inhabited by witches and devils, suggested the expression "still-vexed Bermoothes,"
               and induced the poet to possess his hero with necromantic influence and supernatural
               agency. Mr. Hunter, in his "Disquisition on the Scene, Origin, Date, &amp;c. of
               Shakspeare's Tempest," has laboured with great ingenuity to prove that the actual
               scene of the play was Lampedusa, "an island of the Mediterranean lying not far out of
               a ship's course passing from Tunis to Naples," and which is uninhabited, and supposed
               by sailors to be enchanted. The same idea was suggested, or occured to Douce, who
               thus speaks of it:--"The Island of Lampedusa is near the coast of Tunis ; and from
               its description, in Dapper, and the real tract of the King of Naples' voyage in
               Shakeseare's Tempest, will turn out to be the veritable island where he was
               shipwrecked, and to which Prospero had been banished, whenever the Italian novel on
               which the play founded shall be discovered." We fervently hope note; being contented
               to believe it rose, like a new Atlantis, at the summons of the poet, and when his
               magic work on it was done:-- </p>
