                  A more appropriate and expressive word, one too, sanctioned in some measure by its

                  Miranda, they are perfectly intelligible. That they were so intended becomes

               <p>Mr. Collier remarks that "This word, of old, was used either as a monosyllable or
                  as a disyllable, as the case might require." This may be questioned. "<hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">Ake</hi>," says Baret in his "Alvearie," "is the Verbe of
                  the substantive <hi rend="slant(italic)">Ach</hi>, ch being turned into k." As a
                     <hi rend="slant(italic)">substantive</hi>, then, the word was written <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">aches</hi>; and pronounced as a dissyllable: when a <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">verb</hi>, it was written <hi rend="slant(italic)"
                     >akes</hi>, and its pronunciation was monosyllabic. This distinction is
                  invariably marked in the old text; thus, in "Romeo and Juliet," Act II. Sc. 5,
                  where it is a verb,-- <lg>
                     <l>"Lord, how my head <hi rend="slant(italic)">akes</hi>, what a head have
                        I."</l>
                  </lg> In "Coriolanus," Act III. Sc. 1,-- <lg>
                     <l>"-- and my soule akes</l>
                     <l>To know,"&amp;c.</l>
                  </lg> And in "Othello," Act IV. Sc. 2,-- <lg>
                     <l>"That the sense <hi rend="slant(italic)">akes</hi> at thee."</l>
                  </lg> While in every instance where it occurs as a substantive, it is spelt as in
                  the passage above, <hi rend="slant(italic)">aches</hi>, and should be so
                  pronounced. </p>

               <p>This is the great crux of the play. No passage in Shakespeare has occasioned more
                  speculation, and on none has speculation proved less happy. The first folio reads,
                  "Most busie <hi rend="slant(italic)">lest</hi>, when I doe it;" the second, "Most
                  busie <hi rend="slant(italic)">least</hi> when I doe it;" Pope prints, "<hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">Least busy</hi> when I do it;" Theobald, "Most <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">busyless</hi> when I do it;" Mr. Holt White suggests,
                  "Most <hi rend="slant(italic)">busiest</hi> when I do it;" and Mr. Collier's
                  annotator, "Most busy,-- <hi rend="slant(italic)">blest</hi> when I do it."
                  Whatever may have been teh word for which "<hi rend="slant(italic)">lest</hi>" was
                  misprinted, "Most busy" and that word bore reference, unquestionably, not to
                  Ferdinand's task, but to the sweet thoughts by which it was relieved. We have
                  substituted <hi>felt</hi> as a likely word to have been mis-set "lest;" but are in
                  doubt whether <hi rend="slant(italic)">still</hi>, in its old sense of <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">ever, always,</hi> is not preferable,-- <lg>

               <p>It was the custom of travellers, when about to make a long voyage, to put out, or
                  invest, a sum of money, upon a guaruntee that they should receive at the rate of
                  five for one if they returned. This species of gambling become so much in vogue at
                  one period that adventurers were in the practice of undertaking dangerous journeys
                  solely upon the speculation of what their <hi rend="slant(italic)"
                     >puttings-out</hi> would yield if they got back safe. Of course when the
                  journey ended fatally, the money they had invested went to the party who had
                  engaged to pay the enormous interst on it. So, in Barnaby Riche's "Faults and
                  Nothing but Faults," 1607: "Those whipsters, that, having spent the greatest part
                  of their patrimony in prodigality, will give out the rest of their stocke <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">to be paid</hi> two or <hi rend="slant(italic)">three for
                     one</hi> upon their return form Rome." See also Fynes Moryson's "Itinerary,"
                  Part I., p. 198, and Taylor, the water poet's pamphlet, called "The Scourge of
                  Basenesse: or the Old Lerry, with a new Kicksey, and a new-cum <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">twang</hi>, with the old Winsey." The ancient reading is
                  usually altered in modern editions to "Each putter-out of <hi rend="slant(italic)"
                     >one for five</hi>," or "Each putter-out <hi rend="slant(italic)">on</hi> five
                  for one," but no change is called for; Shakespeare and his contemporaries commonly

               <p>The striking the top masts was a new invention in Shakespeare's time, which he
                  here very properly introduces. Sir Henry Manwaring says, "It is not yet agreed
                  amongst all seamen whether it is better for a ship to hull with her topmast up or
                  down." In the Postscript to the Seaman's dictionary, he afterwards gives his own
                  opinion: "If you have sea-room, it is never good to strike the topmast."
                  Shakespeare has placed his ship in the situation in which it was indisputably
                  right to strike the topmast, when he had not sea-room.</p>

         <head>The Tempest.</head>
         <div type="prefatory">
            <p>The earliest copy of "The Tempest" known is that in the folio of 1623. To the precise
               date of its production we have no clue, but the following memorandum from the
               "Accounts of the Revels at Court," is almost positive testimony that it was written
               before 1611:--</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="align(left)indent(1)">By the King's Players.</hi><hi rend="align(right)">
                  Hallomas nyght was presented att Whithall ye Kinges Matle, a play called the
                  Tempest</hi></p>

            <p>And the speech of Gonzalo, Act II. Sc. 1,--</p>
            <lg>
               <l>"I' the commonwealth I would by contraries," &amp;c.--</l>
            </lg>
            <p>which is obviously taken from a passage in Florio's translation of Montaigne's
               Essayes, first printed in 1603, is equally decisive as to its having been written
               after that year. The story upon which "The Tempest" is founded, was most probably
               dervied, according to Shakespeare's usual practice, from an existing play or from
               some popular chronicle or romance. Collins the poet, indeed, informed T. Warton, that
               he had met with a novel called <hi rend="slant(italic)">Aurelio and Isabella</hi>,
               printed in Italian, Spanish, French, and English, in 1588, which he conceived to have
               formed the basis of "The Tempest." When he spoke of the circumstance, however,
               Collins was labouring under mental debility, and so far as the particular novel he
               mentioned was concerned his memory deceived him, for the fable of Aurelio and
               Isabella bears no resemblance to that of the play; yet it is remarkable that a friend
               of James Boswell declared that he had once perused an Italian novel which answered to
               Collins's description. In an article on the early English and German dramas published
               in the New Monthly Magazine for January, 1841, Mr. Thoms pointed out a dramatic piece
               by Jacob Ayrer, a notary of Nurnberg, contemporary with Shakespeare, entitled <hi
                  rend="slant(italic)">Die schöne Sidea</hi>, (The Beautiful Sidea,) which bears
               some resemnblance to "The Tempest," and which Tieck conjectured was a translation of
               some old English drama from which Shakespeare borrowed his idea. How far this is
               probably the reader must judge from the following outline of the German play: Ludolph
               having been vanquished by his rival, and with his daughter Sidea driven into a
               forest, rebukes her for complaining of their change of fortune, and then summons his
               spirit Runcifal, who is, like Ariel, somewhat "moody," announces to Ludolph that the
               son of his enemy will shortly become his prisoner. After a comic episode, most
               probably introduced by the German, we see Prince Leudegast, with his son Engelbrecht
               and the councillors, hunting in the same forest; when Engelbrecht and his companion
               Famulus, having separated from the associates, are suddenly encountered by Ludolph
               and his daughter. On his commanding them to yield themselves prisoners, they refuse;
               but on attempting to draw their swords, Ludolph renders them powerless by the touch
               of his magical wand, and gives the prince over to Sidea to carry logs of wood for
               her, and to obey her commands in all respects. The resemblance between the German and
               English plays is continued in a later part of the former production, when Sidea,
               moved by pity for the labours of Engelbrecht in carrying logs, exclaims, she would
               "feel great joy, if he would prove faithful to me, and take me in wedlock;" an event
               which in the end, is happily brought about, and leads to the reconciliation of their
               parents, the rival princes. The title of "The Tempest" is supposed by some
               commentators to have been determined by the shipwreck of Sir George Sommers and Sir
               Thomas Gates on the coast of the Bermudas in 1609;</p>

            <p>of which an account was published by Silvester Jourdan,one of the crew, in the
               following year:-- <hi rend="slant(italic)">A Discovery of the Barmudas ; otherwise
                  called the Isle of Divels ; by Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Sommers, and Captayne
                  Newport, with divers others.</hi> It is highly probable, too, that Jourdan's and
               other accounts of the Bermudas, by some of which they are said to be enchanted and
               inhabited by witches and devils, suggested the expression "still-vexed Bermoothes,"
               and induced the poet to possess his hero with necromantic influence and supernatural
               agency. Mr. Hunter, in his "Disquisition on the Scene, Origin, Date, &amp;c. of
               Shakspeare's Tempest," has laboured with great ingenuity to prove that the actual
               scene of the play was Lampedusa, "an island of the Mediterranean lying not far out of
               a ship's course passing from Tunis to Naples," and which is uninhabited, and supposed
               by sailors to be enchanted. The same idea was suggested, or occured to Douce, who
               thus speaks of it:--"The Island of Lampedusa is near the coast of Tunis ; and from
               its description, in Dapper, and the real tract of the King of Naples' voyage in
               Shakeseare's Tempest, will turn out to be the veritable island where he was
               shipwrecked, and to which Prospero had been banished, whenever the Italian novel on
               which the play founded shall be discovered." We fervently hope note; being contented
               to believe it rose, like a new Atlantis, at the summons of the poet, and when his
               magic work on it was done:-- </p>

               <p>The following observations on the maritime technicalities in this scene, are
                  extracted from an article by Lord Mulgrave, which will be found at length in
                  Boswell's Variorum edition of Shakespeare, 1821:--</p>
               <p>"The first scene of The Tempest is a very striking instance of the great accuracy
                  of Shakeseare's knowledge in a professional science, the most difficult to attain
                  without the help of experience. He must have acquired it by covnersation with some
                  of the most skilful seamen of that time. No books had then been published on the
                  subject.</p>
               <p>"The succession of events is strictly observed in the natural progress of the
                  distress described; the expedients adopted are the most proper that could have
                  been devised for a chance of safety: and it is neither to the want of skill of the
                  seamen, or the bad qualities of the ship, but solely to the power of Prospero,
                  that the shipwreck is to be attributed.</p>
               <p>"The words of command are not only strictly proper, but are only such as point the
                  object to be attained, and no suprefluous ones of detail. Shakespeare's ship was
                  too well manned to make it necessary to tell the seamen how they were to do it, as
                  well as what they were to do.</p>
               <p>"He has shown a knowledge of the new improvements, as well as the doubtful points
                  of seamanship; one of the latter he has introduced, under the only circumstance in
                  which it was indisputable.</p>
               <p>"The events certainly follow too near one another for the strict time of
                  representation: but perhaps, if the whole length of the play was divided by the
                  time allowed by the critics, the portion allotted to this scene might not be too
                  little for the whole. But he has taken care to mark intervals between the
                  different operations by exits.</p>

               <p>According to the system of witchcraft or magic, which was formed an article of
                  popular creed in Shakespeare's day, the elementary spirits were divided into six
                  classes by some demonologists, and into four,-- those of the <hi

                  the <hi rend="slant(italic)">Fire</hi>, and of the <hi rend="slant(italic)"
                     >Earth</hi>,-- by others. In the list of characters appended to "The Tempest"
                  in the first folio, Ariel is called "an ayrie spirit." The particular funcions of
                  this order of beings, Burton tells us, are to cause "many tempests, thunder, and
                  lightnings, tear oaks, fire steeples, houses, strike men and beasts, make it rain
                  stones, &amp;c., cause whirlwinds on a sudden, and <hi rend="slant(italic)"
                     >tempestuous storms</hi>." But at the behest of the all-powerful magician
                  Prospero, or by his own influence and potency, the airy spirit in a twink becomes
                  not only a spirit of fire-- one of those, according to the same authority, which
                  "commonly work by blazing stars, fire drakes, or <hi rend="slant(italic)">ignes
                     fatui</hi>; *** counterfeit suns and moons, stars oftentimes, and sit upon

                  places at once. I informed myself of learned men afterward what that light should
                  be, and they said, that it was but a congelation of the winde and vapours of the

               <p>Shakespeare's first knowledge of the storm-vex'd coast of the Bermudas, was
                  probably acquired from Sir Walter Raleigh's "Discoverie of the Large, Rich, and
                  Beautiful Empire of Guiana," 1596, wherein, after speaking of the Channel of
                  Bahama, the author adds,-- "The rest of the Indies for calms, and diseases, are
                  very troublesome; and the <hi rend="slant(italic)">Bermudas</hi> a hellish sea,

                  information from Hakluyt's Voyages, 1600, in which there is a description of
                  Bermuda, by Henry May, who was shipwrecked there in 1593.</p>

               <p>It is impossible to doubt that Shakespeare in this sublime passage remembered the

               <p>With regard to the disputed word, "<hi rend="slant(italic)">rack</hi>," which some
                  editors, Mr. Dyce among them, conceive to be no more than an old form of <hi

                  "Specimen of a Commentary on Shakespeare," &amp;c., pp. 194-198, and Horne Tooke's
                  <!--i do not have a damn clue what that is in the facsimile--> , Vol. II. pp.
                  389-396. To what those writers have said on the subject we have only to add, that
                  while it is evident that by <hi rend="slant(italic)">rack</hi> was understood the

                  would appear that Shakespeare, in the present instance, as in another, occurring

               <p>-- was thinking not more of the actual clouds than of those gauzy semblances
                  which, in the pageants of his day as in the stage-spectacles of ours, were often
                  used partly or totally to obscure the scene behind. Ben Jonson, in the
                  descriptions of his masques, very frequently mentions this scenic contrivance.
                  Thus in his "Entertainment at Theobalds:" -- "The King and Queen, with the princes
                  of Wales and Lorrain, and the nobility, being entered into the gallery after
                  dinner, there was seen nothing but a traverse of white across the room; which
                  suddenly drawn, was discovered a gloomy obscure place, <hi rend="slant(italic)"
                     >hung all with black silks,</hi>" &amp;c. Again, in his "Masque of Hymen:"--
                  "At this, the whole scene being drawn again, and <hi rend="slant(italic)">all
                     covered with clouds, as at night,</hi> they left off their intermixed dances,
                  and returned to their first places."</p>
               <p> The evanishing of the actors, then in Prospero's pageant-- whom</p>
               <lg>

               <p>--was doubtless effected by the agency of filmy curtains which, being drawn one
                  over another to resemble the flying mists, gave to the scene an appearance of
                  gradual dissolution; when the objects were totally hidden, the drapery was
                  withdrawn in the same manner, veil by veil, till at length even that too had
                  disappeared and there was left, then, not even a <hi rend="slant(italic)"

               <p>Mr. Hunter successfully exposed the error of those editors who deemed it necessary
                  to change the old spelling of "<hi rend="slant(italic)">line</hi>-grove," to "<hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">lime</hi>-grove;" see note (ᵃ), p. 41; but to our thinking
                  he has committed a graver mistake than theirs in his ingenious endeavour to prove
                  that the "line" in this passage meant a <hi rend="slant(italic)">line-tree</hi>;--
                  "When," he observes, "Prospero says to Ariel, who comes in bringing the glittering
                  apparel, 'Come, hang them on this line,' he means on one of the line-trees near
                  his cell, which could hardly have been if the word of the original copies, <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">line-grove</hi>, had been allowed to keep its place. But
                  the ear having long been familiar with <hi rend="slant(italic)">lime-grove</hi>,
                  the word suggested not the branches of a tree so-called, but a <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">cord-line</hi>, and, accordingly, when the play is
                  represented, such a line is actually drawn across the stage, and the glittering
                  apparel is hung upon it. Anything more remote from poetry than this can scarcely
                  be imagined."-- <hi rend="slant(italic)">Disquisition on Shakespeare's

               <p>However unpoetic, and perhaps, as Mr. Knight has remarked, the incidents of the

                  rendered so, it is hardly possible to conceive that the coarse jesting,--

                  timber exposed to the action of the sea, became, when broken off, a kind of goose.
                  Some, indeed, supposed that the barnacles actually grew on trees, and thence
                  dropping into the sea, became geese; and an interesting cut of these birds so
                  growing, from a MS. of the fourteenth century, is given by Mr. Halliwell, who
