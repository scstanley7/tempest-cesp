         <h1>The Tempest.</h1>
         
         
         <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The earliest copy of "The Tempest" known is that in the folio of 1623. To the precise
            date of its production we have no clue, but the following memorandum from the
            "Accounts of the Revels at Court," is almost positive testimony that it was written
            before 1611:--
         </p>
         
         <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
            By the King's Players.
            Hallomas nyght was presented att Whithall ye Kinges Matle, a play called the
            Tempest
         </p>
         
         
         <p style="text-indent: 50px;">And the speech of Gonzalo, Act II. Sc. 1,--</p>
         
         
         <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"I' the commonwealth I would by contraries," &amp;c.--</p>
         
         
         <p style="text-indent: 50px;">which is obviously taken from a passage in Florio's translation of Montaigne's
            Essayes, first printed in 1603, is equally decisive as to its having been written
            after that year. The story upon which "The Tempest" is founded, was most probably
            dervied, according to Shakespeare's usual practice, from an existing play or from
            some popular chronicle or romance. Collins the poet, indeed, informed T. Warton, that
            he had met with a novel called Aurelio and Isabella,
            printed in Italian, Spanish, French, and English, in 1588, which he conceived to have
            formed the basis of "The Tempest." When he spoke of the circumstance, however,
            Collins was labouring under mental debility, and so far as the particular novel he
            mentioned was concerned his memory deceived him, for the fable of Aurelio and
            Isabella bears no resemblance to that of the play; yet it is remarkable that a friend
            of James Boswell declared that he had once perused an Italian novel which answered
            to
            Collins's description. In an article on the early English and German dramas published
            in the New Monthly Magazine for January, 1841, Mr. Thoms pointed out a dramatic piece
            by Jacob Ayrer, a notary of Nurnberg, contemporary with Shakespeare, entitled Die schöne Sidea, (The Beautiful Sidea,) which bears
            some resemnblance to "The Tempest," and which Tieck conjectured was a translation
            of
            some old English drama from which Shakespeare borrowed his idea. How far this is
            probably the reader must judge from the following outline of the German play: Ludolph
            having been vanquished by his rival, and with his daughter Sidea driven into a
            forest, rebukes her for complaining of their change of fortune, and then summons his
            spirit Runcifal, who is, like Ariel, somewhat "moody," announces to Ludolph that the
            son of his enemy will shortly become his prisoner. After a comic episode, most
            probably introduced by the German, we see Prince Leudegast, with his son Engelbrecht
            and the councillors, hunting in the same forest; when Engelbrecht and his companion
            Famulus, having separated from the associates, are suddenly encountered by Ludolph
            and his daughter. On his commanding them to yield themselves prisoners, they refuse;
            but on attempting to draw their swords, Ludolph renders them powerless by the touch
            of his magical wand, and gives the prince over to Sidea to carry logs of wood for
            her, and to obey her commands in all respects. The resemblance between the German
            and
            English plays is continued in a later part of the former production, when Sidea,
            moved by pity for the labours of Engelbrecht in carrying logs, exclaims, she would
            "feel great joy, if he would prove faithful to me, and take me in wedlock;" an event
            which in the end, is happily brought about, and leads to the reconciliation of their
            parents, the rival princes. The title of "The Tempest" is supposed by some
            commentators to have been determined by the shipwreck of Sir George Sommers and Sir
            Thomas Gates on the coast of the Bermudas in 1609;
         </p>
         
         
         
         
         <p style="text-indent: 50px;">of which an account was published by Silvester Jourdan,one of the crew, in the
            following year:-- A Discovery of the Barmudas ; otherwise
            called the Isle of Divels ; by Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Sommers, and Captayne
            Newport, with divers others. It is highly probable, too, that Jourdan's and
            other accounts of the Bermudas, by some of which they are said to be enchanted and
            inhabited by witches and devils, suggested the expression "still-vexed Bermoothes,"
            and induced the poet to possess his hero with necromantic influence and supernatural
            agency. Mr. Hunter, in his "Disquisition on the Scene, Origin, Date, &amp;c. of
            Shakspeare's Tempest," has laboured with great ingenuity to prove that the actual
            scene of the play was Lampedusa, "an island of the Mediterranean lying not far out
            of
            a ship's course passing from Tunis to Naples," and which is uninhabited, and supposed
            by sailors to be enchanted. The same idea was suggested, or occured to Douce, who
            thus speaks of it:--"The Island of Lampedusa is near the coast of Tunis ; and from
            its description, in Dapper, and the real tract of the King of Naples' voyage in
            Shakeseare's Tempest, will turn out to be the veritable island where he was
            shipwrecked, and to which Prospero had been banished, whenever the Italian novel on
            which the play founded shall be discovered." We fervently hope note; being contented
            to believe it rose, like a new Atlantis, at the summons of the poet, and when his
            magic work on it was done:-- 
         </p>
         
         
         <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"From that day forth the Isle had beene</p>
         
         <p style="text-indent: 50px;">By wandering sailors never seene :</p>

            <p>(1) Scene I.-- We split,
               we split!
            </p>
            
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The following observations on the maritime technicalities in this scene, are
               extracted from an article by Lord Mulgrave, which will be found at length in
               Boswell's Variorum edition of Shakespeare, 1821:--
            </p>
            
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"The first scene of The Tempest is a very striking instance of the great accuracy
               of Shakeseare's knowledge in a professional science, the most difficult to attain
               without the help of experience. He must have acquired it by covnersation with some
               of the most skilful seamen of that time. No books had then been published on the
               subject.
            </p>
            
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"The succession of events is strictly observed in the natural progress of the
               distress described; the expedients adopted are the most proper that could have
               been devised for a chance of safety: and it is neither to the want of skill of the
               seamen, or the bad qualities of the ship, but solely to the power of Prospero,
               that the shipwreck is to be attributed.
            </p>
            
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"The words of command are not only strictly proper, but are only such as point the
               object to be attained, and no suprefluous ones of detail. Shakespeare's ship was
               too well manned to make it necessary to tell the seamen how they were to do it, as
               well as what they were to do.
            </p>
            
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"He has shown a knowledge of the new improvements, as well as the doubtful points
               of seamanship; one of the latter he has introduced, under the only circumstance in
               which it was indisputable.
            </p>
            
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"The events certainly follow too near one another for the strict time of
               representation: but perhaps, if the whole length of the play was divided by the
               time allowed by the critics, the portion allotted to this scene might not be too
               little for the whole. But he has taken care to mark intervals between the
               different operations by exits.

            <p>(2) Scene
               II.-- Ariel.
            </p>
            
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">According to the system of witchcraft or magic, which was formed an article of
               popular creed in Shakespeare's day, the elementary spirits were divided into six
               classes by some demonologists, and into four,-- those of the Air, of the Water, of
               the Fire, and of the Earth,-- by others. In the list of characters appended to "The Tempest"
               in the first folio, Ariel is called "an ayrie spirit." The particular funcions of
               this order of beings, Burton tells us, are to cause "many tempests, thunder, and
               lightnings, tear oaks, fire steeples, houses, strike men and beasts, make it rain
               stones, &amp;c., cause whirlwinds on a sudden, and tempestuous storms." But at the behest of the all-powerful magician
               Prospero, or by his own influence and potency, the airy spirit in a twink becomes
               not only a spirit of fire-- one of those, according to the same authority, which
               "commonly work by blazing stars, fire drakes, or ignes
               fatui; *** counterfeit suns and moons, stars oftentimes, and sit upon
               ship-masts"-- but a naiad, or spirit of the water
               also: in fact. assumes any shape, and is visible or unseen at will.

               Saint Peter, and Saint Nicholas. "Whenever
               it appeared as a single flame, it was supposed by the ancients to be Helena, the sister of Castor and Pollux; and in this
               state to bring ill-luck form the calamities which this lady is known to have
               caused in the Trojan war. When it came double, it was called Castor and Pollux,
               and accounted a good omen."

               during the "Voyage of Robert Tomson Marchant, into Nova Hispania, in the yeere
               1555:"--
            </p>
            
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"I do remember that in the great and boysterous storme of this foule weather, in
               the night, there came upon the toppe of our maine yarde and maine maste, a
               certaine little light, much like unto the light of a little candle, which the
               Spaniards called the Cuerpo santo, and saide it was
               S. Elmo, whom they take to be the advocate of
               sailers.*** This light continued aboord our ship about three houres, flying from
               maste to maste, and from top to top: and sometime it would be in two or three
               places at once. I informed myself of learned men afterward what that light should
               be, and they said, that it was but a congelation of the winde and vapours of the
               sea congealed with the extremitie of the weather, which, flyinge in the winde,
               many times doeth chance to hit on the masts and shrowds of the ships that are at
               sea in foule weather. And in trueth I do take it to be so: for that I have seene
               the like in other ships at sea, and in sundry ships at once."-- Hakluyt, III. 450, ed. 1600

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Shakespeare's first knowledge of the storm-vex'd coast of the Bermudas, was
               probably acquired from Sir Walter Raleigh's "Discoverie of the Large, Rich, and
               Beautiful Empire of Guiana," 1596, wherein, after speaking of the Channel of
               Bahama, the author adds,-- "The rest of the Indies for calms, and diseases, are
               very troublesome; and the Bermudas a hellish sea,
               for thunder, lightning, and storms." (See Chalmers' Apology, p. 578.) Or he might have derived his
               information from Hakluyt's Voyages, 1600, in which there is a description of
               Bermuda, by Henry May, who was shipwrecked there in 1593.

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">It has been surmised that the idea of this marvellous creation was derived from
               the subjoined passage in Eden's "History of Travayle in the West and East Indies,"
               4to., London, 1577-- a book from which it is exceedingly probably that Shakespeare
               borrowed the names of some of the principal characters of this piece, as Alonso,
               Ferdinand, Sebastian, Gonzalo, Antonio, &amp;c.

               the pole antartike; where being wyntered, they were inforced to remayne there for
               the space of two monethes: all which tyme they sawe no man, excepte that one day
               by chaunce they espyed a man of the stature of a giant, who came to the haven
               daunsing and singying, and shortly after seemed to cast dust over his head. The
               captayne sent one of his men to the shore, with the shyppe boate, who made the
               lyke signe of peace. The which thyng the giant seeyng, was out of feare, and came
               with the captayne's servaunt, to his presence, into a little ilande. When he sawe

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"of his company about hym, he was greatly amased, and made signes, holdying up his hande to heaven, signifying thereby, that
               our men came from thence. This giant was so byg, that the head of one of
               our men of a meane stature came but to his waste. He was of good corporature, and
               well made in all partes of his bodie, with a large cisage painted with divers
               colours, but, for the most parte, yelow. Uppon his cheekes were paynted two
               hartes, and red circles about his eyes. The heare of his head was coloured whyte,
               and his apparell was the skynne of a beast sowde togeather. This beast, as seemed
               unto us, had a large head, and great eares lyke unto a mule, with the body of a
               camell and tayle of a horse. The feete of the giant were foulded in the sayde
               skynne, after the manner of shooes. *** The captayne caused him to eate and
               drynke, and gave him many thinges, and among other a great lookyng glasse, in the
               which, as soon as he sawe his owne lykeness, was sodaynly afrayde, and started
               backe with such violence,that hee overthrew two that stoode nearest about him.
               When the captayne had thus gyven him certayne haukes belles, and other great
               belles, with also a lookyng glasse, a combe, and a payre of beades of glasse, he
               sent him to lande with foure of his owne men well armed."

               a bad sore, is mentioned in a tract on hawking, MS. Harl. 2340. An analogous use
               of the word, fierce, savage, is mentioned in A

               considerable light on these lines, but furnish at the same time grounds for a
               conjecture that Shakespeare was indebted to it, with a slight alteration, for the
               name of Caliban's mother, Sycorax the witch. "The raven is called corvus of Corax . . . . it is said that ravens birdes be fed with deaw of heaven all the time that they have no black feathers by benefite of age," lib. xii. c. 10. The
               same author will also account for the choice which is made, in the monster's

               evidently a favourite of the poet, and furnished him with the materials for

               old Venetian voyager; who, in lib. I. ch. 44, describing the desert of Lop, in
               Asia, says:-- 'Audiuntur ibi voces dæmonum, &amp;c. voces fingentes eorum quos

               instrumentorum.'" This work was translated into Enlgish by John Frampton in 1579,
               under the title of "The Most Noble and famous Travels of Marcus Paulus, one of the
               Nobilitie of the State of Venice," &amp;c., and the above passage is rendered:--

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">With regard to the disputed word, "rack," which some
               editors, Mr. Dyce among them, conceive to be no more than an old form of wreck, the reader is recommended to consult Whiter's
               "Specimen of a Commentary on Shakespeare," &amp;c., pp. 194-198, and Horne Tooke's
               Επϵα Πτϵρυϵντα, Vol. II. pp. 389-396. To what those writers have said on the
               subject we have only to add, that while it is evident that by rack was understood the drifting vapour, or scud as it is now termed, it would appear that
               Shakespeare, in the present instance, as in another, occurring in "Antony and
               Cleopatra," Act IV. Sc. 12,--
            </p>
            
            
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"That which is now a horse, even with a thought</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">-- was thinking not more of the actual clouds than of those gauzy semblances
               which, in the pageants of his day as in the stage-spectacles of ours, were often
               used partly or totally to obscure the scene behind. Ben Jonson, in the
               descriptions of his masques, very frequently mentions this scenic contrivance.
               Thus in his "Entertainment at Theobalds:" -- "The King and Queen, with the princes
               of Wales and Lorrain, and the nobility, being entered into the gallery after
               dinner, there was seen nothing but a traverse of white across the room; which
               suddenly drawn, was discovered a gloomy obscure place, hung all with black silks," &amp;c. Again, in his "Masque of Hymen:"--
               "At this, the whole scene being drawn again, and all
               covered with clouds, as at night, they left off their intermixed dances,
               and returned to their first places."

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">--was doubtless effected by the agency of filmy curtains which, being drawn one
               over another to resemble the flying mists, gave to the scene an appearance of
               gradual dissolution; when the objects were totally hidden, the drapery was
               withdrawn in the same manner, veil by veil, till at length even that too had
               disappeared and there was left, then, not even a rack behind.

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Mr. Hunter successfully exposed the error of those editors who deemed it necessary
               to change the old spelling of "line-grove," to "lime-grove;" see note (ᵃ), p. 41; but to our thinking
               he has committed a graver mistake than theirs in his ingenious endeavour to prove
               that the "line" in this passage meant a line-tree;--
               "When," he observes, "Prospero says to Ariel, who comes in bringing the glittering
               apparel, 'Come, hang them on this line,' he means on one of the line-trees near
               his cell, which could hardly have been if the word of the original copies, line-grove, had been allowed to keep its place. But
               the ear having long been familiar with lime-grove,
               the word suggested not the branches of a tree so-called, but a cord-line, and, accordingly, when the play is
               represented, such a line is actually drawn across the stage, and the glittering
               apparel is hung upon it. Anything more remote from poetry than this can scarcely
               be imagined."-- Disquisition on Shakespeare's

               lose your hair, and prove a bald jerkin;" and,--

               Some, indeed, supposed that the barnacles actually grew on trees, and thence
               dropping into the sea, became geese; and an interesting cut of these birds so
               growing, from a MS. of the fourteenth century, is given by Mr. Halliwell, who
               observes that "the

               absurdity of our old writers, as Douce has observed, consisted in their believing
               that this bird was really produced from the shell of the fish." Innumerable

         <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"It is observed of 'The Tempest,' that its plan is regular. This the author of 'The
            Revisal' thinks, what I think too, an accidental effect of the story, not intended
            or
            regarded by our author. But whatever might be Shakespeare's intention in forming or
            adopting the plot, he has made it instrumental to the production of many characters,
            diversified with boundless invention, and preserved with profound skill in nature,
            extensive knowledge of opinions, and accurate observation of life. In a single drama
            are here exhibited princes, courtiers, and sailors, all speaking in their real
            characters. There is the agency of airy spirits, and of an earthly goblin; the
            operations of magick; the tumults of a storm, the adventurs of a desart island, the
            native effusion of untaught affection, the punishment of guilt, and the final
            happiness of the pair for whom our passions and reason are equally interested."--
            Johnson.

         <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> "'The Tempest,' according to all appearance, was written in Shakespeare's later
            days: hence most critics, on the supposition that the poet must have continued to
            improve with increasing maturity of mind, have honoured this piece with a marked
            preference over the 'Midsummer Night's Dream.' I cannot, however, altogether concur
            with them: the internal merit of these two works are, in my opinion, pretty nearly
            balanced, and a predilection for the one or the other can only be governed by
            personal taste. In profound and original characterisation, the superiority of 'The
            Tempest' is obvious: as a whole we must always admire the masterly skill which he
            has
            here displayed in the economy of his means, and the dexterity with which he has
            disguised his preparations,-- the scaffoldings for the wonderful aërial
            structure.

         <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"'The Tempest' has little action or progressive movement; the union of Ferdinand and
            Miranda is settled at their first interview, and Prospero merely throws apparent
            obstacles in their way; the shipwrecked band go leisurely about the island; the
            attempts of Sebastian and Antonio on the life of the King of Naples, and the plot
            of
            Caliban and the drunken sailors against Prospero, are nothing but a feint, for we
            foresee that they will be completely frustrated by the magical skill of the latter;
            nothing remains therefore but the punishment of the guilty by dreadful sights which
            harrow up their consciences, and then the discovery and final reconciliation. Yet
            this want of movement is so admirably concealed by the most varied display of the
            fascination of poetry, and the exhilaration of mirth, the details of the execution
            are so very attractive, that it requires no small degree of attention to perceive
            that the denouement is, in some degree, anticipated in the exposition. The history
            of
            the loves of Ferdinand and Miranda, developed in a few short scenes, is enchantingly
            beautiful: an affecting union of chivalrous magnanimity on the one part, and on the
            other of the virgin openness of a heart which, brought up far from the world on an
            uninhabited island, has never learned to disguise its innocent movements. The wisdom
            of the princely hermit Prospero has a magical and mysterious air; the disagreeable
            impression left by the black falsehood of the two usurpers is softened by the honest
            gossiping of the old and faithful Gonzalo; Trinculo and Stephano, two
            good-for-nothing drunkards, find a worthy associate in Caliban; and Ariel hovers
            sweetly over the whole as the personified genius of the wonderful fable.
         </p>
         
         <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"Caliban has become a by-word as the strange creation of a poetical imagination. A
            mixture of gnome and savage, half demon, half brute, in his behavior we perceive at
            once the traces of his native disposition, and the influence of Prospero's education.
            The latter could only unfold his understanding, without, in the slightest degree
            taming his rooted malignity: it is as if the use of reason and human speech were
            communicated to an awkward ape. In inclination Caliban is malicious, cowardly, false,
            and base; and yet he is essentially different from the vulfar knaves of a civilized
            world, as portrayed occasionally by Shakespeare. He is rude, but not vulgar; he never
            falls into the prosaic and low familiarity of his drunken associates, for he is, in
            his way, a poetical being; he always speaks in verse. He has picked up everything
            dissonant and thorny in language to compose out of it a vocabulary of his own; and
            of
            the whole variety of nature, the hateful, repulsive, and pettily deformed, have alone
            been impressed on his imagination. The magical world of spirits, which the staff of
            Prospero has assembled on the island, casts merely a faint reflection into his mind,
            as a ray of light which falls into a dark cave, incapable of communicating to it
            either heat or illumination, serves merely to set in motion the poisonous vapours.
            The delineation of this monster is throughout inconceivably consistent and profound,
            and, notwithstanding its hatefulness, by no means hurtful to our feelings, as the
            honour of human nature is left untouched.
         </p>
         
         <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"In the zephy-like Ariel, the image of air is not to be mistaken, his name even bears
            an allusion to it; as, on the other hand, Caliban signifies the heavy element of
            earth. Yet they are neither of them simple, allegorical personifications, but beings
            individually determined. In general we find in the 'Midsummer Night's Dream,' in 'The
            Tempest,' in the magical part of 'Macbeth,' and wherever Shakespeare avails himself
            of the popular belief in the invisible presence of spirits, and the possibility of
            coming in contact with them, a profound view of the inward life of nature and her
            mysterious springs, which, it is true, can never be altogether unknown to the genuine
            poet, as poetry is altogether incompatible with the mechanical physics, but which
            few
            have possessed in an equal degree with Dante and himself."--Schlegel.
