                     <lb/>never deſign'd it for her. In the firſt Place, 'tis probable
                     <lb/>Proſpero taught Caliban to ſpeak, rather than left that Office
                     <lb/>to his Daughter: in the next Place, as Proſpero was here rating
                     <lb/>Caliban, it would be a great Impropriety for her to take the
                     <lb/>Diſcipline out of his Hands; and, indeed, in ſome ſort, an In-
                     <lb/>decency in her to reply to what Caliban, laſt was ſpeaking of.
                     <lb/>Mr. Dryden, I obſerve, in his Alteration of this Play, has ju-
                     <lb/>diciouſly placed this Speech to Proſpero. I can eaſily gueſs,
                     <lb/>that the Change was firſt deriv'd from the Players, who not
                     <lb/>loving that any Character ſhould ſtand too long ſilent on the
                     <lb/>Stage, to obviate that Inconvenience with Regard to Miranda,
                     <lb/>clap'd this Speech to her Part.
