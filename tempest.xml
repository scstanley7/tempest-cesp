                     <lb/>Speech is given to Miranda: but I am perſuaded, the Author
                     <lb/>never deſign'd it for her. In the firſt Place, 'tis probable
                     <lb/>Proſpero taught Caliban to ſpeak, rather than left that Office
                     <lb/>to his Daughter: in the next Place, as Proſpero was here rating
                     <lb/>Caliban, it would be a great Impropriety for her to take the
                     <lb/>Diſcipline out of his Hands; and, indeed, in ſome ſort, an In-
                     <lb/>decency in her to reply to what Caliban, laſt was ſpeaking of.
                     <lb/>Mr. Dryden, I obſerve, in his Alteration of this Play, has ju-
                     <lb/>diciouſly placed this Speech to Proſpero. I can eaſily gueſs,
                     <lb/>that the Change was firſt deriv'd from the Players, who not
                     <lb/>loving that any Character ſhould ſtand too long ſilent on the
                     <lb/>Stage, to obviate that Inconvenience with Regard to Miranda,
                     <lb/>clap'd this Speech to her Part.

                  <lb/>(7) Alon. Pr'ythee, peace.] All that follows from hence to 
                  <lb/>this ſpeech of the King's,
                  <lb/>You cram theſe Words into my Ears againſt
                  <lb/>The Stomach of my Senſe.
                  <lb/>ſeems to Mr. Pope to have been an Interpolation by the Play-
                  <lb/>ers. For my part, tho' I allow the Matter of the Dialogue to
                  <lb/>be very poor and trivial, (of which, I am ſorry to ſay, we
                  <lb/>don't want other Inſtances in our Poet;) I cannot be of this 
                  <lb/>Gentleman's Opinion, that it is interpolated. For ſhould we
                  <lb/>take out this intermediate Part, what would become of theſe
                  <lb/>Words of the King?
               </p>
               <p>
                  <lb/>―Would I had never
                  <lb/>Married my Daughter there!
               </p>
               <p>
                  <lb/>What Daughter? and where married? For it is from this inter-
                  <lb/>mediate Part of the Scene only, that we are tols, the King had
                  <lb/>a Daughter nam'd Claribel, whom he ad married into Tunis.
                  <lb/>'Tis true, in a ſubſequent Scene, betwixt Antonio and Sebaſtian,
                  <lb/>we again hear her and Tunis mention'd: but in ſuch a manner,
                  <lb/>that it would be quite obſcure and unintelligible without this
                  <lb/>previous Information. Mr. Pope's Criticiſm therefore is inju-
                  <lb/>dicious and unweigh'd. Beſides, poor and jejune as the Mat-
                  <lb/>ter of the Dialogue is, it was certainly deſign'd to be of a ri-
                  <lb/>diculous Stamp; to divert and unſettle the King's Thoughts
                  <lb/>from reflecting too deeply on his Son's ſuppos'd Drowning.
